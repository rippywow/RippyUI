### How to Install

Backup your old WTF and Interface Folder, put mine in their place.
To use custom fonts, rename "Fonts1" or "Fonts2" (whichever you want to use) to "Fonts" and place into your WoW Folder (Not Addons)

### How to keep your Keybinds and Macros

From your old WTF folder, take your bindings-cache.wtf and macros-cache.wtf and overwrite them in my WTF folder.
You can find bindings-cache.wtf and macros-cache.wtf inside the following two folders
1) WTF/Account/[ACCNAME] 
2) WTF/Account/[ACCNAME]/[ServerName]/[CharacterName] 

### First Run Guide

1) You have to resize the chat yourself.

2) Enemy nameplates by default aren't shown. You can enable in interface options or use default keybind V.

3) Your fivesecondrule(the blue bar that shows when your mana starts to regen after casting) is out of place, you need to reposition fivesecondrule. Use /fsr unlock to move, left click bar to move it right click bar to resize it.

4) Your castbar is default. You need to type /ecb and go to the profiles tab, select "rippy" and then press load.

### FAQ
