# RippyUI

Collection of addons with slight modifications to make a UI I enjoy.

### How to Install

Backup your old WTF and Interface Folder, put mine in their place.

### How to keep your Keybinds and Macros

From your old WTF folder, take your bindings-cache.wtf and macros-cache.wtf and overwrite them in my WTF folder.
You can find bindings-cache.wtf and macros-cache.wtf inside the following two folders
1) WTF/Account/[ACCNAME] 
2) WTF/Account/[ACCNAME]/[ServerName]/[CharacterName] 

### First Run Guide

1) You have to resize the chat yourself.

2) Enemy nameplates by default aren't shown. You can enable in interface options or use default keybind V

3) Your fivesecondrule(the blue bar that shows when your mana starts to regen after casting) is out of place, you need to reposition fivesecondrule. Use /fsr unlock to move, left click bar to move it right click bar to resize it.

4) Your castbar is default. You need to type /ecb and go to the profiles tab, select "rippy" and then press load.
